# RPS-Multiplayer
Any two can play. . .This is a two-player rock, paper, scissors game that uses JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. Additionally, we utlize Firebase to ensure there are only two players in the game at a time, track their choices, wins and losses, and enable chat functionality.

Each player is asked to input their name before the game starts.
When player one enters their name, they see the player boxes.
Once player two enters their name, the game is now in play, and both player one and two see a chatbox to interact with the other player.
When a player's turn is active, they will see "It's your turn!", their box highlighted, and be able to pick from rock, paper, scissors options.
When it's the other player's turn, they will see "Waiting for [other player] to choose, and the other box will be highlighted.
After both players choose, the results box will populate with "[player] wins!", or "Tie game!".
If not a tie, the players' outcomes will update according to the result.
